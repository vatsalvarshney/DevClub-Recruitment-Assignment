# DevClub Recruitment Assignment
## Mittal Sports Complex Booking

Presenting a simple and interactive web-app for booking slots for Mittal Sports Complex of IIT Delhi. This is a primarily backend project built on `Django` framework. Frontend is based on mostly `BootStrap4`.

Website is hosted on Heroku: https://mittalsc-booking.herokuapp.com/

Design Document for the project is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kCWqLbppyysGdceFvo4WX6vD9CdN7u02/view?usp=sharing)

### Data for testing on hosted website
- One admin user with username and password both `admin`
- One staff user with username and password both `staff`
- Five members with usernames `useri` and passwords `passi` where `i=1,2,3,4,5`. Preferably login with user1 as more dummy data is associated with it
- Meaningful amount of dummy data is associated with the sport `Badminton` for the arena `Court-1`, so preferably view that part
